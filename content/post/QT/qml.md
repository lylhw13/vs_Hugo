# [The QML Reference](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmlreference.html)

# [QML Object Attributes](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-syntax-objectattributes.html)

This id must begin with a lower-case letter or an underscore, and cannot contain characters other than letters, numbers and underscores.

Property names must begin with a lower case letter and can only contain letters, numbers and underscores.

Properties are type safe. A property can only be assigned a value that matches the property type.



### [First Steps with QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmlfirststeps.html#)

One of the great advantages of using QML to define a user interface is that it allows the user interface designer to define how the application should react to events with simple JavaScript expressions. In QML, we refer to those events as signals and these signals are handled by signal handlers.

### [Deploying QML Applications](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-deployment.html)
If application.qml does not have any graphical components, or if it is preferred to avoid QQuickView for other reasons, the QQmlEngine can be constructed directly instead.
