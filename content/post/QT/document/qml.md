- ApplicationWindow is a Window with some added convenience for creating a header and a footer. It also provides the foundation for popups and supports some basic styling, such as the background color.
- Label extends the primitive Text item from the Qt Quick module by adding styling and font inheritance. 
- We set the text of the label using the qsTr() function, which ensures that the text can be translated by Qt's translation system. It's a good practice to follow for text that is visible to the end users of your application.
- Pane is basically a rectangle whose color comes from the application's style. It is similar to Frame, with the only difference being that it has no stroke around its border.
