Refer to [GTX 560Ti not showing max resolution over HDMI [continued]](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2v15oo/gtx_560ti_not_showing_max_resolution_over_hdmi/)

1. Right click desktop->nvidia control panel
2. Display->Change resolution
3. Customise...
4. Create custom resolution.
5. Type in the resolution 2560, 1440
6. Change timing from Automatic to CVT-RB. CVT will also work, but CVT-RB is better from a technical point of view. Information about the modes is here.
7. Apply, etc.
