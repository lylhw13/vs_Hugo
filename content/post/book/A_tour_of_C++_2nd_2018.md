Think of a sightseeing tour of a city, such as Copenhagen or New York. In
just a few hours, you are given a quick peek at the major attractions, told a few background stories, and given some suggestions about what to do next. You do not know the city after such a tour. You do not understand all you have seen and heard. You do not know how to navigate the formal and informal rules that govern life in the city. To really know a city, you have to live in it, often for years. However, with a bit of luck, you will have gained a bit of an overview, a notion of what is special about the city, and ideas of what might be of interest to you. After the tour, the real exploration can begin.
