- `eth0` is the first Ethernet interface. (Additional Ethernet interfaces would be named eth1, eth2, etc.) This type of interface is usually a NIC connected to the network by a category 5 cable.
- `lo` is the loopback interface. This is a special network interface that the system uses to communicate with itself.
- `wlan0` is the name of the first wireless network interface on the system. Additional wireless interfaces would be named wlan1, wlan2, etc.

ifconfig can only assign a static IP address to a network interface. If you want to assign a dynamic IP address using DHCP, you should use the dhclient command.
